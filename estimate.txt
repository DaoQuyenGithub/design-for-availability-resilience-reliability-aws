1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
In AWS Documentation said: "Amazon RDS automatically switches to a standby replica in another Availability Zone if you have 
turned on Multi-AZ. The time that it takes for the failover to complete depends on the database 
activity and other conditions at the time the primary DB instance became unavailable. Failover times are typically 60–120 seconds"
-> RTO switches to a standby replica in another Availability Zone if the failover times are typically 60–120 seconds. 
So Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage around 60 seconds.


2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage
00:00 - Problem happens (0 minutes)
00:05 - An amount of time passes before an alert triggers (5 minutes)
00:06 - Alert triggers on-all staff (1 minute)
00:16 - On-call staff get out of bed, get to computer, log in (10 minutes)
00:31 - Use existing replica and promote to master (15 minutes)
00:45 - Reconfigure the application to point to new DB instance (4 minutes)
-> Total time: 45 minutes
Minimum RTO for a single region outage around 45 minutes. 

3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
RDS takes transaction log backups every 5 minutes. At the most data loss will be of 5 minutes.
-> Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage is 5 minutes

4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage
Read replica are almost sync data with the Primary database. So we can consider at most the RPO can be ±10 mins.
-> Minimum RPO for a single region outage is 10 minutes
